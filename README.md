# Serverless Scaffolder

The Serverless Scaffolder is a highly opinionated AWS Lambda generator built using the Yeoman scaffolding tool. This tool is fantastic for spinning up new Lambda projects very quickly and so works well in conjunction with a microservices based architecture.

## Getting Started

Install Yeoman and the scaffolder via npm:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-serverless-scaffolder
```

Move into the directory you wish to create your app in (e.g. projects/) and run the generator:

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder
```

Answer the questions when prompted. The app will now be generated with everything you need to start a Lambda based project.

## What is generated?

- src folder with index.js and Lambda entry point function
- Linter with opinionated linting rules
- .gitignore file which includes files you will typically want to keep out of your git repository
- .nvmrc which locks the Lambda to Node version 10.14.1. This can be changed if needed. To use the version included here install nvm and run `nvm use`
- Pre-commit rules which (among other things) ensures AWS keys are not accidentally posted to a git repository (pre-commit will need to be installed for this to work)
- The Jest testing suite to unit test code
- A package.json file with all the necessarry npm installs and commands to get you started developing Lambda functions
- A Readme with all the information you'll need to get started

## Subgenerators

### Service

To generate a new service in the `src/services` folder of your generated project run

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:service
```

This will create a new service class and Jest test file to unit test the aforementioned class.

### Util

To generate a new set of utils in the `src/utils` folder of your generated project run

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:util
```

This will create a new util file and Jest test file to unit test the aforementioned functions.

### Constants

To generate a new constants file in the `src/constants` folder of your generated project run

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:constants
```

This will create a new constants file.

### Errors

To generate a new error type file in the `src/errors` folder of your generated project run

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:error
```

This will create a new error class which can then be imported and thrown in any project JavaScript file.

### Infrastructure As Code - CI (iac-ci)

To generate all associated Terraform to standup CodeBuild/CodePipeline for a dev/test environment located in `iac/`. This should be run from the root folder of your generated project.

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:iac-ci
```

All code will be generated in `iac/`.

### Infrastructure As Code - Lambda (iac-lambda)

To generate all associated Terraform to standup lambda infrastructure for a dev/test environment. This should be run from the root folder of your generated project.

```bash
yo serverless-scaffolder:iac-lambda
```

All code will be generated in `iac/lambda`
